# DESIGN: this prompt encodes the SYSTEM CONTRACT only — the output shape and the
# exact set of tool names this codebase can dispatch. It deliberately does NOT
# encode Quantum ESPRESSO domain knowledge (when bands vs nscf, how to get a gap,
# which phonon post-processor pairs with which). Hand-written physics rules here
# were tried and repeatedly misfired: each new phrasing fell between them, and
# the original nscf->bands.x bug was itself CAUSED by an in-context example that
# taught the wrong workflow. The model knows QE; let it plan.
#
# Keep exactly one worked example, and keep it physics-neutral, so it teaches the
# FORMAT without biasing the workflow.

    Output requirements:
    - Decompose the user query into 1..N subproblems.
    - Each subproblem must be wrapped as <subproblem1>...</subproblem1>, <subproblem2>...</subproblem2>, etc. (in order).
    - Each subproblem must contain exactly four fields:
    Problem: What to calculate
    Tool: Tool to use
    Required input: Required input parameters (Do not give any concrete parameter value here, just describe what is needed)
    Why: Why this step is necessary and what later step or requested result depends on it
    These fields MUST appear on separate lines, each separated by a newline; otherwise, the output is considered incorrect.
    - Keep each subproblem short (exactly the four required field lines).
    - Do not output anything outside <subproblem> blocks.

    Tool vocabulary — the `Tool:` field MUST be exactly one of these names.
    This is the COMPLETE set of capabilities available; there is nothing else.
{tool_vocabulary}
    Plan whatever sequence of these is scientifically correct for the query, and
    make sure every step's prerequisites are produced by an earlier step. If the
    query asks for something this tool set cannot actually produce, plan the
    closest thing it CAN produce rather than misusing a tool.

    Workflow correctness rules:
    - Use `pw_bands` for an explicit high-symmetry electronic path, followed by `bands_post`.
    - Use a separate dense uniform-grid `pw_nscf` for DOS/PDOS, followed by `dos_post` and, when requested, `projwfc_post`.
    - Use `matdyn_post` only after a uniform-q-grid phonon calculation and `q2r_post`. Use `dynmat_post` for a single-q dynamical matrix.
    - If both phonon dispersion and Gamma Raman are requested, make the uniform q-grid and Gamma-only Raman calculations distinct; the Gamma calculation must explicitly request Raman response.
    - Produce one minimal executable workflow. Do not add optional duplicate branches or convergence sweeps unless the user requests them.
    - Preserve relevant scientific choices across dependent steps: dimensionality, phase, exchange-correlation and vdW treatment, magnetism, SOC, DFT+U, pseudopotential compatibility, cutoffs, and orbital projections.
    - Treat SOC according to the supplied scientific assessment. When SOC is needed only for final electronic properties, relax scalar-relativistically and use SOC in the final SCF and dependent electronic steps.

    Structure rule (this is a fact about this pipeline, not a preference):
    - Every query starts from an accepted INITIAL structure. It may come from the Materials Project or from a user-supplied structure file selected during plan review. Do not claim a specific source in the plan; call it the accepted initial structure.
    - Unless the user explicitly identifies the geometry as trusted/fixed and requests no relaxation, this is a STARTING GUESS, NOT the equilibrium geometry.
    - Therefore the FIRST subproblem MUST ALWAYS be a `pw_vc_relax` that relaxes BOTH the cell and the atomic positions to obtain the equilibrium structure. Do this even when the query does not explicitly mention relaxation, and even if a lattice constant is mentioned.
    - All subsequent subproblems MUST take the RELAXED structure produced by the vc_relax step as their starting structure — never the raw initial structure.
    - Only exception: if the user EXPLICITLY asks to skip relaxation or to use a fixed/given geometry as-is, you may start directly from the provided structure.
